# Lua On Arduino

Copy the `/loa_firmware` folder to your arduino's sd card inside a `lua` folder in the sd cards root directory.
So the complete path on your sd card should be `lua/loa_firmware`.

See [Lua On Arduino's Desktop repository](https://github.com/lua-on-arduino/desktop) for a complete setup.
